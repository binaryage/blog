**[Bitcoin](http://bitcoin.org) is the [next big thing](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/06/bitcoin-inside-the-encrypted-peer-to-peer-currency.ars) and I want to support the emerging economy around this new currency. Today I start offering TotalFinder for bitcoins and let people earn some bitcoins by referring TotalFinder to friends.**

### Trade TotalFinder for bitcoins (50% price off)

Interested? Please send me an [email](mailto:antonin@binaryage.com?subject=TotalFinder%20for%20bitcoins). I will reply with current quote in BTC and my address where I accept your payment. I will send a free license link back when I get 10+ confirmations of the payment.

The price will be 50% of the usual price denominated in BTC <- [previous close on MtGox exchange](http://www.bitcoincharts.com/markets/mtgoxUSD.html).

### Get 10% from TotalFinder sales in bitcoins

You may refer people to my site by giving them urls with your bitcoin address as a referrer parameter:

    http://totalfinder.binaryage.com?referrer=BITCOINADDRESS
    http://sites.fastspring.com/binaryage/product/store?referrer=BITCOINADDRESS
    or any other similar link to my site or FastSpring e-shop

Technically that referrer parameter will be [stored in cookie for 14 days](https://github.com/binaryage/layouts/blob/master/default2.html#L511-516) and passed to my e-commerce provider if the user purchases something. Then I will do manual bitcoin transfers (not later than on sunday).

I've just setup a fund of 300BTC for this purpose - which should be enough to get it going until I earn first bitcoins myself :-)

Note: This way you may get 10% of your own money back in bitcoins. This may be an easy way how to get some bitcoins if you are considering buying TotalFinder anyway and wanted to try bitcoin out.

### Asking why am I doing it?

* I'm a hacker who is super excited about bitcoin idea and design.
* I'm a geek and early adopter. I like to try new technology. Also this is a novel marketing experiment.
* I'm curious and want to support bitcoin economy by offering my products and services on bitcoin market.

Please note that this is an experimental offer. I may discontinue it anytime for any reason.
