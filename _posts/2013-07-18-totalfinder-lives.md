As we mentioned in our <a href="http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/mavericks">Mavericks compatibility page</a>, we are continuing to port TotalFinder to Mavericks.  People are still talking about key features, like the <a href="http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/dual-mode">side-by-side window mode</a>, <a href="http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/folders-on-top">folders on top</a>, and the <a href="http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/browser">automatic resizing</a> of column widths when using column view.

We're making great progress and could use your help on the latest revisions.  If you want to be part of the beta test for OS X 10.9 Mavericks, <a href="http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/beta-changes">check out this page</a>.
