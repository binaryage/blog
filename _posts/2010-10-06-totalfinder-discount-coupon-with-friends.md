** I have been giving <a href="http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/free-licenses">free licenses</a> to people who contributed their time to TotalFinder.<br>As a side effect I've also had tons of emails from students <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/student_discount-457pf">asking for a free license or discount</a>. Their reason is mostly "because I'm poor" or something similar. **

#### I have also been a student for a big part of my life

But asking for something just because I was poor always seemed like a bad idea to me. Next time **ask how you can help** and offer something you can do in exchange! We all have 24 hours per day at our disposal.

#### Asking how you can help? Good!

You can help me sell more TotalFinder licenses and earn a $5 discount for yourself and 2 other friends.<br>You have some friends, right? Doing something for your friends for free is always a good idea.

You may want to [visit this page](http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/licenses-for-friends) which will help you send a message to your friends.

#### How does it work?

You buy <a href="https://sites.fastspring.com/binaryage/instant/totalfinder-friends">TotalFinder Friends</a> for $30 and I will send you a classic license plus two coupons as URLs. You can then send the coupon links to your friends. Either as a gift or they can give you $10 back.

#### What if I have a multi-license already?

<a href="mailto:antonin@binaryage.com">Send me a request</a> and I will re-license the multi-license for you. The discount is the same.

#### What's next?

Ok, guys. This was the last marketing task I have on my list for now. I'd rather spend time coding than thinking how to squeeze even more dollars from the product. It was a pretty juicy week already :-) 

Now let's get back to work on TotalFinder features and bug-fixes.
