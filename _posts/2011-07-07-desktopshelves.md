**This is a guest post from my friend Rico, another Indie Mac developer
over at Kitestack Software who has just released version 1.0 of his app DesktopShelves.**

Thanks Antonin for giving me the opportunity to introduce DesktopShelves to
your readers!

DesktopShelves is an app that lets you 
[organize your Mac's desktop](http://kitestack.com/desktopshelves/ "Organize your Mac's desktop").
If you have what it feels like a million files cluttering up your desktop and cleaning up means creating a 
folder called "*Stuff*" and putting everything inside, DesktopShelves is an app for you.

DesktopShelves does exactly what the name suggests: it puts shelves on your
desktop. A shelf the size of 5 regular desktop icons holds 20 files. That is
possible, because items on a shelf are slightly rotated like books on a real
shelf. In contrast to a shelf made out of metal and wood, a desktop shelf has a
nice Cover Flow-like effect to zoom in to the file under the cursor to make it easy
to find the file you are looking for.

You can open any folder on your Mac as a shelf on the desktop. Let's say you
are working on a project for a client. In Finder, you can just right-click the
project folder and open it as a shelf. This way you will have access to all
files right from the desktop. There's also a hotkey to bring the shelves on 
top of all other open windows.

Getting files on and off shelves works via drag & drop. You can, for example,
drag and drop a file from a shelf directly into Mail.app and send it as an
attachment. If you right-click (or control-click) and drag a text file away
from a shelf it will insert the actual contents of that file. This lets you 
keep a shelf with text snippets or email templates.

To take this one step further, you can also select text in an application such as
Safari and drop it directly on a shelf. There it will automatically create a
new file with that text selection for you.

DesktopShelves comes as a 14 day demo version with all features enabled. After that you can purchase a license for $15.
You can **[download DesktopShelves](http://kitestack.com/desktopshelves/ "DesktopShelves website")** from the Kitestack website.
