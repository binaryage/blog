**I'm happy to announce that BinaryAge just got a new design!<br/>Big kudos to <a href="http://raist.cz">Raist</a> who redesigned [the site](http://binaryage.com) for me.**

#### How do you like it?

#### For historical comparison here is the old homepage design:

#### Who is that magician Raist?

He has been a very best friend of mine for very long time. Back in old times we did some artistic [demoscene work](http://hildebrand.cz/marshals-web) together with other folks from <a href="http://marshals.cz/">marshals.cz</a>. Those times are over but we are still in the computer business. He is a freelance graphics designer and I'm a contract programmer. From time to time we join together to get some job done. Ehmm yes, most of the time I want some work from him :-)

#### Meet Cloudia

[Raist](http://raist.cz) has been working with our great friend [Surgi](http://webaplications.com) on a new business for a while. The shiny product is called [Cloudia CMS](http://www.cloudia.cz/eng) and it is a flexible multi-site CMS with an awesome admin interface built with ExtJS library. See the [screenshots](http://www.cloudia.cz/eng)!

I have not worked with the system personally, but I can recommend those guys, because I know they are doing a great job. If you are ever looking for a multi-site CMS which is expected to process great amounts of data you should definitely not miss Cloudia!

#### Tasty ingredients powering the new site

#### Improved XRefresh and Jekyll along the way

Of course I do eat my own dog food, so I used XRefresh, FireQuery, Visor and TotalFinder heavily while working on the changes. 

Actually I did more than that! I even contributed a few fixes to XRefresh and Jekyll:

* [http://github.com/binaryage/xrefresh/commit/0f0050f69fb841df7e42266a274313b948b206d9](http://github.com/binaryage/xrefresh/commit/0f0050f69fb841df7e42266a274313b948b206d9)
* [http://github.com/darwin/jekyll/tree/optimize_static_files](http://github.com/darwin/jekyll/tree/optimize_static_files)
* [http://github.com/darwin/jekyll/tree/site_url_from_cmdline](http://github.com/darwin/jekyll/tree/site_url_from_cmdline)

The XRefresh improvement especially is sweet. I hope I will manage to find some time for a new XRefresh release soon.

**Please report any weird experiences with the new site. Also please note that this site is not optimized for IE. According to Google Analytics, I'm getting less than 2% IE visitors, so it is simply not worth the headache.**
