** I will be attending WWDC this year. Yes I'm super excited that I have won the ticket lottery this year :-) **

#### Tabs in OS X 10.9?

This will be my first WWDC ever. I've heard many good things about WWDC so I have pretty high expectations.

I'm interested in all the dev stuff, but for us as a company the most important will be the revealing of OS X 10.9. There were some [rummors](http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/29/4281684/os-x-10-9-rumored-redesigned-finder-with-tabbed-browsing) that Apple is going to implement native tabs in Finder. I believe TotalFinder success helped to shape their decision to finally include tabs in Finder. And without hacks! :-)

We have some ideas about new products. I also look forward for new opportunities any new changes could bring.

#### Let's meet!

If you happen to be at WWDC, [let's meet](mailto:antonin@binaryage.com). You can always watch the sessions from recordings, but networking can be done only in person :) Looking forward to see you there.
