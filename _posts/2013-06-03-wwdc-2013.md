** I will be attending WWDC this year. Yes, I'm super excited that I won the ticket lottery this year :-) **

#### Tabs in OS X 10.9?

This will be my first WWDC ever. I've heard many good things about WWDC so I have pretty high expectations.

I'm interested in all the dev stuff, but for us as a company the most important will be the revealing of OS X 10.9. There are [rumors](http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/29/4281684/os-x-10-9-rumored-redesigned-finder-with-tabbed-browsing) that Apple is going to implement native tabs in Finder. If it's true, I believe TotalFinder's success helped shape their decision to finally include tabs in Finder. And without hacks! :-)

Don't worry. We have some ideas for future products. I also look forward to new opportunities that the new OS may bring. But we want to hear also from the community. What would dramatically improve your daily computer life? Please <a href="mailto:ideas@binaryage.com">share it with us</a>.

#### Let's meet!

If you happen to be at WWDC, [let's meet](mailto:antonin@binaryage.com). You can always watch the sessions from recordings but networking can be done only in person.  Looking forward to see you there!
