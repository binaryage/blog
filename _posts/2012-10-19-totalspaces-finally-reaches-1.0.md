** [TotalSpaces](http://totalspaces.binaryage.com) is finally reaching version 1.0. **

#### 1.0.0 Release date is 22.10.2012

Hi, Stephen here... I am excited to make an announcement: Yes, TotalSpaces is ready for release. No, it's not perfect, and we didn't get time to put in every one of the features that you have requested. But I feel we have come far enough for it to be a really useful piece of software, and it's also stable an well tested by thousands of users. 

All in all, we're really happy with TotalSpaces, and we've had many nice comments from our users.

#### It was a long road

TotalSpaces was born at the end of August 2011 as Change Space App, something I wrote in my spare time to get back my well loved spaces grid. Change Space worked, but it had some deficiencies and I could see that it was going to require a significant change in the way the app worked in order to improve it. I was going to need to write a plugin for the OSX Dock app in order to do everything I wanted.

The first incarnation of this was called ReSpaceApp, which was first released on 1st February 2012. Development proceeded well, and by April you could pull up an overview grid, with the ability to drag and drop windows between desktops.

At the end of April I teamed up with Antonin, and ReSpaceApp took its place in the Binaryage portfolio as TotalSpaces.

June brought a much improved overview grid, with an exposé type feature to enable you to get a good view of all your windows.

During the summer and autumn we continued to improve and refine the app, whilst adding some of the most requested features.

#### Full feature list

So finally TotalSpaces is ready to be called v1.0.0. Along the way, we have implemented all these features:

* Grid layout of **up to 16 desktops** built on top of Mission Control's native OSX desktops
* Switching desktops via **hotkeys**, **swiping**, the TotalSpaces menu, dragging windows to the sides of the screen, via the overview grid, or even just by placing your mouse at an edge of the screen if you configure it so
* **Transitions**: Four different animation effects with configurable transition period, or option to **turn transitions off altogether**
* **Full circulation control**
* **Overview grid** triggerable by hotkeys, third mouse button, or from the TotalSpaces menu
* Ability to **drag windows between desktops** in the overview grid
* Ability to set how dragging windows places the windows in the new space in the overview grid
* **Multiple monitor support**
* Choice of resolutions for desktop backgrounds in the overview grid
* **Full screen apps** in the grid (via Advanced preferences), or to the right of the grid
* Configuration option to show full screen apps below the overview grid
* Configuration to show or hide the notification graphic on desktop change
* Configuration to hide the menu bar icon
* **Hotcorners** to trigger the overview grid, and exposé mode once in the overview grid
* Configuration for **assigning apps to particular spaces**

And actually we are going to squeeze a one or two extra features into version 1.0, including desktop naming.

#### Pricing

TotalSpaces has been on sale whilst it has been in beta at a price of $12. This is the introductory price - **You can still purchase TotalSpaces at this price until v1.0 is released, after which the price goes up to $15.** So buy now :)

All licenses are valid for all upgrades to TotalSpaces in the v1.x series.

#### Finally

Thanks to everyone who has provided feedback and suggestions for TotalSpaces. There is more coming, we are going to continue to work hard on TotalSpaces making it better, faster, easier and more delightful to use.
