** Today, I'm happy to announce a new major release of TotalFinder. The new version [includes Cut&Paste and many small improvements and fixes](http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/changes). You may grab TotalFinder 1.1 today [for just $9 via MacUpdate Promo](http://mupromo.com/TotalFinder). **

#### Cut&Paste should be a human right

We all know Cut&Paste when working with text, right? [Move files and folders with cut & paste](http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/move_files_and_folders_with_cut_past) was the single most requested feature on the forums.  Now you can start using  ⌘+X and  ⌘+V to cut and paste files in TotalFinder. It works like a charm!

I'm really happy about the implementation, because we tricked the Finder into thinking that you just did Drag & Drop internally. I believe the feature is rock solid and covers all the possible scenarios which may arise with Drag & Drop. You know, dealing with files is a serious business and I'm really careful about it.

This feature was implemented by [Roman Yusufkhanov](https://github.com/akahan) who is the new guy helping me with TotalFinder programming. I plan to do a small interview with him in some future blog post. So you guys can get to know him a bit more personally.

#### Check out products at [Kapeli.com](http://kapeli.com)

Perhaps you know the utility called [MoveAddict](http://kapeli.com) by **Bogdan Popescu**, which aims to solve the same problem. I'm a bit sad to compete with Bogdan, because he definitely put a lot of good work into his app and this release will harm his sales I guess. But I feel strongly that Cut&Paste should be an integral part of TotalFinder and as the most requested feature this is the best thing for my users.

Please do me a favor. Visit his site and [check out some of the other products](http://kapeli.com/switche) he has created. Much appreciated, thanks!

#### TotalFinder is on sale via [MacUpdate Promo](http://mupromo.com) today!

The price is set to $9 which is 40% discount. Given that the Cut&Paste feature alone has the price tag $8 (MoveAddict), you will get great value for a really great price. I hope you like my aggressive pricing.

#### What's next?

TotalFinder is selling very well and I'm pretty busy with supporting all the people. The development is slower but I'm getting great help from [Roman](https://github.com/akahan), [Sebastian](http://getsatisfaction.com/people/sebastian_tischer), [Lorenzo](http://getsatisfaction.com/people/kiwidesign), [Robin](http://robinraszka.com), [Melda](http://github.com/melda) and [others](https://github.com/binaryage/totalfinder-i18n/contributors). Also I'd like to thank all the translators for [keeping up](https://github.com/binaryage/totalfinder-i18n/network) with recent TotalFinder changes.
