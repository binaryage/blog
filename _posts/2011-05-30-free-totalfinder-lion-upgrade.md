**Good news! I'm happy to announce that all existing users will get TotalFinder Lion upgrade for free. On the other hand I will increase TotalFinder price for new customers the same day Apple releases Lion. Please read the details below.**

### The summary

  * Single TotalFinder binary will work on both Snow Leopard and Lion without restrictions
  * There will be no TotalFinder upgrade fee for Lion
  * When Apple releases Lion, I will increase the price to $18 (currently $15)
  * For EU customers I won't cover VAT in the price anymore

#### Single TotalFinder executable

I made some nice progress on [Lion compatibility](http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/lion). I'm pretty confident that I will be able to provide all TotalFinder features under Lion. The bonus is that I was able to implement it in a single binary, so there should be no headaches with maintaing two separate plugins.

#### You get a TotalFinder upgrade for free

A quote from TotalFinder [licensing page](http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/licensing):
> A new major OS release (OS X 10.7) will probably require substantial rewrites and intensive testing. I may charge existing users an upgrade fee for a new OS. I expect it to be 50% of the full price.

This time I've decided to give it for free and here are my main reasons:

1. all TotalFinder licenses are less than a year old, I don't feel it is fair to charge you twice per year
2. sales are still pretty strong and it covers my development costs [happy face]
3. you supported me in the early days by buying it, you are all early adopters, thank you!

#### TotalFinder price will go up

TotalFinder is definitely getting better. It is still not perfect, but we are getting there. For example I've [added cut&paste](/totalfinder-with-cut-and-paste) which alone added [value of $8](http://kapeli.com). I'm committed to continue. I have some great ideas on the list.

But I have different arguments why TotalFinder price should go up:

1. I believe that early adopters should get a better price
2. I have been overwhelmed with user support lately, by increasing the price I get less people jumping in, which gives me more time for real development, instead of sitting in gmail all day long
3. I live in the Czech Republic and [the dollar lost ~20% against Czech currency during last year](http://www.google.com//finance?chdnp=1&chdd=1&chds=1&chdv=1&chvs=Linear&chdeh=0&chfdeh=0&chdet=1306772121487&chddm=359060&q=CURRENCY:USDCZK&ntsp=0)

#### I will stop paying taxes for EU customers

Last year when I was opening [the store](http://sites.fastspring.com/binaryage/product/store) via [FastSpring](http://fastspring.com) I've selected option to hide VAT in the price. The [VAT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_added_tax) is similar to sales taxes in the U.S.

Why did I do that? Well, here in Europe, it is common that end-user prices in stores are displayed including VAT and people don't think about it (what a great social hack, isn't it?). I wanted my ordering process to be as seamless as possible and I didn't want to spend time explaining people why they should pay 20% more than is advertised on the homepage.

Why it was a mistake? Simply it is not fair. It creates inequality between customers. Some pay more than others. For example from U.S. citizens I get full $15, while for example from German guys I get roughly $12.5. I have to collect the remaining $2.5 for German government (as a VAT).

I'm libertarian by heart and I have to fix this. The day Apple releases Lion I will flip the switch. This will make TotalFinder more expensive for EU customers (according to their country's VAT rate).

### The bottom line

Ok, those changes won't be popular but I believe they are the right thing to do. Complain to your governments, not me.

If you've already bought your TotalFinder copy you made a good investment. It helps you every day with Finder and the value is increasing over time (hopefully). And I will do my best to keep it that way!
