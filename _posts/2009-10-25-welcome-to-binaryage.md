**Hello! I'm <a href="http://hildebrand.cz">Darwin</a> from BinaryAge<br/>and you are probably a software developer interested in some of <a href="http://binaryage.com">my tools</a>.**

#### This is just the beginning

I prefer to spend my time writing actual code than writing articles, so please don't expect this to be a frequent blog. I'm going to announce here all major binaryage releases. This will also be the best place to explain and discuss new features. I want also share here general ideas, cool tools I find online and productivity tips I'm practicing during my development.

If you prefer short realtime updates about what I'm working on, please consider subscribing <a href="http://twitter.com/binaryage">on twitter</a>.

I look forward to meeting people here, who are passionate about development tools and open-source in general.
