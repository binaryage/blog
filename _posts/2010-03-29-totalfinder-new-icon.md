**Real quick today. I want to show you a new icon for TotalFinder. I want to roll it into the next release.**

TotalFinder is slowly growing from a hacker-style geek guy into a very nice and friendly Mac citizen. I think it's the time to take off the shades! I believe the new icon reflects this perfectly. Again credit goes to <a href="http://raist.cz">Raist</a> who created it. Thanks!

#### How do you like it?

#### Also modified blog part of the site

I've had some complaints about the font readability on the site. I didn't have much time to play with the web site again, but I disabled the BitLow font at some places. Hope it helps a bit.
