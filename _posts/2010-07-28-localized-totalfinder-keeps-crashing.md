**My mom always told me: "write automated tests, my boy"<br>But you know... I had always better things to do.**

#### After expiration TotalFinder wants to say something...

But my localization function crashes for some reason in Russian, Japanese and Chinese versions. And maybe in others too! <strike>I would guess translators haven't used localization string placeholders correctly or it's something on my side.</strike>

The reason was much simpler. I just used a plain C string instead of Objective-C NSString at one place when printing expiration info. This caused the crash in all versions regardless of localization state. This bug affects both 0.9.5 and 0.9.6. 

#### The rescue: Please upgrade to TotalFinder 0.9.9 manually

I'm sorry for the inconvenience. The bug has been fixed from 0.9.7.
