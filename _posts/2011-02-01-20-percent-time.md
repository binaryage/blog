**This is a bit of a schizophrenic situation, but I just agreed with myself to spend 20% time on projects which are not related to TotalFinder. Yes, inspired by [Google's idea](http://lifehacker.com/5497057/set-up-your-own-google+style-20+percent-time-to-try-new-projects).**

#### It has to be fun!

Working on TotalFinder is still fun. But the time I spend on emails is greater than the time spent programming new features. Nobody can do support better than me. Sad, but true.

I spent last weekend with friends and other folks at [GameJam Prague](http://gamejamprague.org). The goal was to create a game in 48 hours. A classic hackathlon-style event, part of the [Global GameJam](http://globalgamejam.org).

I'm a big believer in new browser technologies, JavaScript and related things. I took the [ImpactJS](http://impactjs.com) game engine and I tried to build a simple game on top of it. I've had this on my list for a while, but never managed to save some time to really get on it.

#### Dino needs love

And this is the game we've created. Many thanks to [Raist](http://raist.cz) who did the graphics and some level design.

It is a really short game with a nice twist at the end. It should take you 5 mins to complete :-)

#### I'm still in love with game making

In my past life I made a living by working on big games. I spent 3 years working on tools for [Mafia2](http://www.mafia2game.com).

But also I've produced my own independent games just for fun. And some unfinished of course...

* **PacWars2** - a remake of very old network game full of pac-mans (2002).
* **SilverStunts** - an experimental game engine in Silverlight (2007).

#### Interested in javascript games?

Show us what are you working on. Maybe we can work together and make something interesting.

*Google Chrome is becoming a new game engine. And people have it already at home!*
