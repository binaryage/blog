** OSX Mavericks public release is almost upon us. What of TotalSpaces? **

#### The new operating system brings many changes

Ever since Apple introduced fullscreen apps, users with more than one display have been staring at a useless blank second monitor while working with a fullsceen app on the other one.
When OSX Mavericks was announced, Apple had done a great thing - they made it possible to keep something different on each of your displays. This was a fundamental change in the system, and one much welcomed by users.

However, I knew this meant a significant change for TotalSpaces. And it turns out there were many other changes under the hood also. In fact, we had to take the whole app to bits, and re-architect it to work with Mavericks. It was frustrating at times, but we were able to clean up and correct earlier mistakes as we went, and I think we ended up with a better result.

The very soul of TotalSpaces is the grid that enables you to keep a mental map of where your windows are. With the new version, I wanted to focus on the grid, to incorporate all types of desktops in it, and to make it easy for you to re-arrange your grid as you work.

#### TotalSpaces2 is designed for Mavericks

And so [TotalSpaces2](http://totalspaces.binaryage.com/index2) was born. It's not exactly the same as TotalSpaces (there are [some differences](http://totalspaces.binaryage.com/differences2)), but it gives you the same grid and the same workflows as before.

You can download TotalSpaces2 here:

TotalSpaces2 works well with both major multi-monitor spaces modes, but the re-written code offers performance benefits and ease of use for single screen users as well.

I hope you like it!

#### Upgrading

TotalSpaces2 was a significant effort, and it is a paid upgrade. However, we are giving a **40% discount** on the full price for earlier users of TotalSpaces.

Also we felt it fair to offer a **free upgrade** if you bought TotalSpaces after Mavericks was announced (10th June 2013).
